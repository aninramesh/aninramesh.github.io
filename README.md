Hello,

I am a dedicated Atmospheric Physicist holding a Ph.D. from the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), USA. My area of expertise lies in aerosol measurement and instrumentation, and I possess a strong foundation in programming languages such as Matlab and Python. I am particularly enthusiastic about the application of aerosol remote sensing techniques and the development of inverse methods to determine aerosol properties using multi-angle polarimetric observations.

Throughout my academic career, I have accumulated extensive experience working with the HARP family of polarimeter data, and I have successfully employed the GRASP algorithm to retrieve aerosol properties. My interest in this field began during my undergraduate studies in Physics when I contributed to a project focused on constructing a cavity-based spectrometer for the purpose of measuring trace gases in the atmosphere.

Upon joining UMBC as a graduate student in 2014, my research interests expanded to encompass both in situ and remote sensing measurements of aerosols. Beyond my passion for atmospheric research, I am an avid backpacker who enjoys exploring national forests, an enthusiastic learner always eager to acquire new technological skills, and an informed individual who remains abreast of current events.

As a valued member of our team, I am committed to advancing the understanding of aerosols and their impact on the environment. My goal is to contribute significantly to the development of cutting-edge remote sensing techniques and to the broader scientific community, while inspiring others to explore and appreciate the wonders of atmospheric physics.
